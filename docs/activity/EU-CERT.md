 |[2023-002: Multiple critical Vulnerabilities in Git](https://cow-www-prod.azurewebsites.net/publications/security-advisories)|During a code audit, X41 discovered several vulnerabilities in the version control system git. On January 17, the git project resolved the two most critical security vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-23521 and CVE-2022-41903) that could allow the remote execution of arbitrary code. GitHub and GitLab have also issued updates for their products, including the latest version of git. A third vulnerability (CVE-2022-41953) affects the Windows version of the Git GUI software and could also lead to the execution of arbitrary code. CERT-EU highly recommend upgrading to the latest version of git. In addition, if you are running on-premise GitHub or GitLab servers, we recommend updating them.|Thursday, January 19, 2023 10:50:00 PM CEST|
