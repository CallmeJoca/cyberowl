 |[2023-004: Critical Vulnerability in Several ManageEngine Products](https://cow-www-prod.azurewebsites.net/publications/security-advisories)|On January 18th, ManageEngine released updates to several ManageEngine OnPremise products. The potentially vulnerable products use outdated versions of the open-source library Apache Santuario (XML Security for Java). Products must have enabled Single-Sign-On (SSO) using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to be vulnerable. For some products, the SSO must be active, while for others, it is sufficient that SSO was active once. As a result, the vulnerability allows an unauthenticated adversary to execute arbitrary code. Additionally, a Proof-of-Concept exploit is available.|Monday, January 30, 2023 10:15:00 AM CEST|
