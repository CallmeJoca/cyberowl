 |[2023-018: Microsoft Outlook Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://cert.europa.eu/static/SecurityAdvisories/2023/CERT-EU-SA2023-018.pdf)|On March 14, 2023, Microsoft released a security fix for an elevation of privilege vulnerability (CVE-2023-23397) in Microsoft Outlook. A specially crafted e-mail can trigger the vulnerability automatically when it is retrieved and processed by the Outlook client. Such an e-mail could lead to exploitation before the e-mail is viewed in the Preview Pane and allows an attacker to steal credential hashes by forcing the targets' devices to authenticate to an attacker-controlled server. The Computer Emergency Response Team for Ukraine (CERT-UA) reported the vulnerability to Microsoft. Based on Microsoft Threat Intelligence, a Russia-based threat actor used it in attacks to target and breach the network of several governments, military, energy, and transportation organisations in Europe between April and December 2022. They used the stolen hashes for lateral movement within the victims' networks and to change Outlook mailbox folder permissions for e-mail exfiltration. Online services such as Microsoft 365 do not support NTLM authentication and are not vulnerable to being attacked by these messages.|Wednesday, March 15, 2023 11:30:00 AM CET|
